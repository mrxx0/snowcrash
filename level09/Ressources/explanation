In this level we have again an executable and token file

Launching the executable shows us that it needs an argument

Let's try with hi

./level09 hi
hj

./level09 12
13

./level09 12345
13579

Hum looks like a pattern here.

Let's try other things

./level09 abcde
acegi

Yes indeed.
We can conclude that the level09 is "hashing" the argument

./level09 XXX
X X + index ........
X X + 1 X + 2.....

Every character is modify with this index value to it's ascii.

Let's try with our token

./level09 token
tpmhr

./level09 $(cat token)
f5mpq;v�E��{�{��TS�W�����

So this should be the password to go log as flag09 but hashed

We need to get its original version
We know how to transform the argument to the output so we can do the same to revert it
Insted of adding the index we can subsctract it.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int ac, char **av)
{

	int i = 0;
	char c = av[1][0];
	while (av[1][i])
	{
		c = av[1][i];
		printf("%c", (c - i));
		i++;
	}
	return (0);
}


Using scp to get the token file and compiling out C code.

We can now revert the hashing

./a.out $(cat token)
f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq

This is our password to log as flag09
