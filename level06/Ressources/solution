On this level we have two files : level06 an executable and level06.php a php 
file.

When executing the level06 there is an error asking for a file as a parameter.

The level06.php contains 2 functions using a regex.
Learning about it on the internet we found that that one of the regex is 
vulnerable to code injection.

Indeed the /e placed in the preg_replace means that all expression in (.*) 
will be evaluated by a fonction.

We need to understand the meaning of the regex to inject a valid command 
and then execute the code we want.
As a reminder we need to launch getflag of access to the flag06 user.

We want to access to the flag06 user so why not ask for a shell access right ?

So if we wrote this "[x {${system(bash)}}]" in a file and we send it to level06
we should have access to flag06's shell.

[x {${system(bash)}}] and boom ! connected as flag06
