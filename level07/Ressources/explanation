In this level we have yet an executable called level07.

Launching it just print 'level07'... nothing realling interesting.
But how does it print it ? 

Let's find out using ltrace and executing level07

We can see that it's getting the env of LOGNAME
And LOGNAME is us : level07
It's also printing by calling to echo from /bin/echo and echoing level07

ltrace doesn't show the exact content of the executable more the final result
So our level07 print isn't printed from the echo directly but from the LOGNAME
env variable.

Let's try to modify it.

export LOGNAME=ls

So our echo command is not printing ls, but it also means we can add something
to our export. Like ... : && SOMETHING right ?

Let's try that

export LOGNAME='ls && echo "hi"'

It's printing ls and "hi" also ! That means we can ask for a shell right ?

export LOGNAME='echo "This is the way" && bash'

And BOOM ! Connected as flag07 now we can call the getflag function.
