When we get to this level, in the home directory there is a pcap file name level02.pcap
A pcap file is a file containing a capture from a network, like wireshark can do.

Using a VM and calling wireshark with the file as an argument, we discover the data of this file.
We can see that there are many connexions to an unknown IP address and nothing interesting.

Wireshark as an option to "follow the stream" so we can use that and see what result of it.

The TCP stream is readable in a human form but not entirely. We need to switch from ASCII mode to UTF-8.

And in front of is the password to get the flag02 :
