When we get to this level, in the home directory there is a pcap file name level02.pcap
A pcap file is a file containing a capture from a network, like wireshark can do.

Using a VM and calling wireshark with the file as an argument, we discover the data of this file.
We can see that there are many connexions to an unknown IP address and nothing interesting.

Wireshark has an option to "follow the stream" so we can use that and see what result of it.

The TCP stream is readable in a human form but not entirely. We need to switch from ASCII mode to UTF-8.
We get this ASCII password before "Password: ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L"

With hexdump we see '.' is 7F and in ascii table is [DEL]

So the valid password is ft_waNDReL0L
