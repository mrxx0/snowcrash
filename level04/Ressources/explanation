In the level there is a perl script in the home directory.

We can execute it but it just prints :
Content-type: text/html

Nothing interesting. If we take a look at that script :

#!/usr/bin/perl
# localhost:4747
use CGI qw{param};
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
sub x {
  $y = $_[0];
  print `echo $y 2>&1`;
}
x(param("x"));

It looks like this script takes a parameter.
So let's try to launch the script with an argument.

perl level04.pl hello
perl level04.pl "hello" "how are u??"

Nothing more....
In the second line of the script there is a comment saying "localhost:4747"

By curiosity I took a look at the /var/www content
And there is indeed an index.html and 2 folders : level04 and level12 and in the level04 directory the same level04.pl script.

So this means that there is a server running on the machine.
Opening a browser and typing the IP of the snowcrash VM (192.168.56.101) on the port 4747 we load a blank page.

Running the script again on the terminal and giving x a value prints the value

perl level04.pl x=hi

Content-type: text/html

hi

So maybe we can try that in the URL ? 
Indeed, giving x a value prints the value in the web page

By looking online of the make echo run a command we discover that we can do that x=$(getflag)

Giving this value to x in the URL launche the getflag command and print the result on the page.
