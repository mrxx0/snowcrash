We connecting to level05, we get a new system mail.

Opening it reveal a crontab scheduled every 2 minutes :

cat /var/mail/level05
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

Opening the /usr/s/bin/openarenaserver script we get :

cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

Looking at /opt/openserver is an empty directory.
But if we understand that script, it loops on everyfile on the directory openarenaserver
Then limitt the amout of time execution to 5 seconds, check and execute the file if exists and then remove it

So we can create a file that calls getflag and redirect the output.

Something like this

getflag > /tmp/flag

after approximatively 2 minutes the script get executed, our file in /opt/openarenaserver is deleted and we have a new file in /tmp/flag containing our flag !
