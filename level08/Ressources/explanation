In this level we have an executable and a file

Trying to launche the executable gets us a message saying that we need to launch
it with a file as parameter.

Let's try to give it the token file present in the home.

We don't have right on it.
Hum.

Let's try to create a file and give it as parameter.

touch /tmp/abc

./level08 /tmp/abc

and no output.

That means it's doing something at least, let's find out what with ltrace

level08 is looking at the name of our parameter and looks for the string "token"

You remember your shell piscine ? Remember symlink ? I do !

Let's try to link a random file in /tmp to our token file.

ln -s /home/user/level08/token /tmp/flag

./level08 /tmp/flag

quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

Is this the flag ? No. We haven't launch getflag.

This is the password to log in as flag08.
