In the home there is an executable called level03.
We can execute it and it prints "Exploit me".

So here we go, we started to analyze the file it should be an ELF.
Let's confirm that, using readelf -a level03

We can see that this file is indeed an ELF, a 32 bit one exactly.
We need more than that, so let's dig deeper on this mysterious file.

With the help of ltrace we execute the file and ltrace will intercept and record all the dynamic library calls but also all the system calls exexecuted by the program.

Let's see the output of ltrace.
There are 2 calls to getegid, and 2 calls to setresgid and 1 system call to /usr/bin/env echo
This is where we are heading, we need to change the call to echo to something else but to what ??
The goal of this project is to get the flag right ? Why not try to execute the getflag function ? Let's try that


After few minutes to find a decent way yo export the echo variable to launch the getflag we finally have the flag.

To do so we first export the getflag to a temporary echo file in /tmp

echo "/bin/sh -c 'getflag'" > /tmp/echo

The -c option is to read commands from the command string aka here 'getflag'
This is written in /tmp/echo

Then we need to have the execution right on it

chmod +x /tmp/echo

After that we would like to add this new echo to the PATH

export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

With all that we can relaunch the ./level03 and we get the flag !
