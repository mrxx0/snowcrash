In the first level00 I discovered in the /etc/passwd a line for flag01 with a hash.
Of course I couldn't use it like that so I ask my friend John if he knew sowmthing about it.

I copy the line of the /etc/passwd to a random file 

flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

then I ask John to take this file and see what he could do about it, and instantly John gave me an answer.

We could see that the hash function used on the password is DES 128.

And the password is abcdefg
