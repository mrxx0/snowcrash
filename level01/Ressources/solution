In the first level00 I discovered in the /etc/passwd a line for flag01 with a hash.
Of course I couldn't use it like that so I ask my friend John if he knew sowmthing about it.

level01@SnowCrash:~$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
...
flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash
...
flag14:x:3014:3014::/home/flag/flag14:/bin/bash

We have the encrypted password of flag01, let's try a password cracker
"John the ripper"

We copy the line of the /etc/passwd to a random file 

flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

then we ask John to take this file and see what he could do about it, and instantly John gave me an answer.

Ok we have flag01's password : abcdefg and we could see that the hash function used on the password is DES 128.
