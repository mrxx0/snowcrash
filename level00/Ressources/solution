In this level we don't have a lot of access on the files or directory resulting in a lot of "Persmissions denied"....
So with that in mind, we wanted to find all the files we could have access to, at least one

In the readme file in intranet's video of Snow Crash we can read,
"FIND this first file who can run only as flag00"

To do that we used the find command.
Used with a specific set of options it results in a list of files in which we are interested.
We want to look for files from the root directory : /
Then we want to specify the group access aka us : flag00

level00@SnowCrash:/$ find -group flag00 2>/dev/null
./usr/sbin/john
./rofs/usr/sbin/john

We don't have excecution permission on them but we can see what's inside:

Let's look at the first one : 

level00@SnowCrash:/$ cat /usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

Let's look at the second file:

cat /rofs/usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

Well it looks like nothing to me, but more as the result of a cipher

Same as the first one, due to the lenght of the text and the probability of it of being a simple viegenere or cesar cipher we used the dcode.fr website to do the work for us.
Looking at the result of the decoding function, one of the result seems to be what we were looking for : nottoohardhere

It's a simple cesar code, (ROT 15 here),
cdiiddwpgswtgt -> nottoohardhere, it's password of flag00

And voila !
