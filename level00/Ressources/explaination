In this level we don't have a lot of access on the files or directory resulting in a lot of "Persmissions denied"....
So with that in mind, we wanted to find all the files we could have access to, at least one

To do that we used the find command.
Used with a specific set of options it results in a list of files in which we are interested.

Here is the commnand

find / -user flag00 -group flag00 2>/dev/null | grep -v 'proc'

We want to look for files from the root directory : /
Then we want to specify the user and group access aka us : flag00
To remove all the error garbage resulting in bad persmission we clear them and grep the 'proc' lines (because we don't have access to them)

The result of the commnand is pretty evident.

/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

We don't have excecution permission on them but we can see what's inside:

Let's look at the first one : 

cat /usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

Well it looks like nothing to me, but more as the result of a cipher

Let's look at the second file:

cat /rofs/usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

Same as the first one, due to the lenght of the text and the probability of it of being a simple viegenere or cesar cipher we used the dcode.fr website to do the work for us.
Looking at the result of the decoding function, one of the result seems to be what we were looking for : nottohardhere

And voila !
